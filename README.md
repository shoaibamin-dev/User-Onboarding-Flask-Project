# User Onboarding Flask Project

This Flask project is designed for user onboarding with search functionalities. Users can sign up, log in, and view a list of registered users. The project utilizes Flask, MySQL for database management, and includes basic HTML templates for user interaction.

## Project Structure

The main project files and directories are organized as follows:

- `__pycache__`: Python bytecode cache directory.
- `app.py`: Flask application main file containing route definitions and backend logic.
- `static`: Directory containing static files such as CSS and images.
  - `images`: Subdirectory holding image resources used in the project.
  - `signup.css`: Stylesheet for the signup page.
- `templates`: HTML templates for rendering pages.
  - `login.html`: Login page template.
  - `signup.html`: Signup page template.
  - `users.html`: Template for displaying a list of registered users.
- `user.sql`: SQL script for creating the necessary MySQL database and table.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python packages:

- Flask: Micro web framework for Python.
- Flask-MySQLdb: Flask extension for MySQL integration.

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-MySQLdb
```

## Database Configuration

Ensure that you have a MySQL server running. Update the MySQL configuration in `app.py`:

```python
app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = ''
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'bank_employee_mgt'
```

## Running the Project

1. Create the MySQL database and table using `user.sql`.
2. Run the Flask application using the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Signup**: Visit `http://localhost:5000/signup` to create a new user account.
- **Login**: Access `http://localhost:5000/login` to log in with your credentials.
- **User List**: After logging in, you can view a list of registered users at `http://localhost:5000/login`.

## Important Notes

- Make sure to configure the MySQL connection details in `app.py`.
- This is a basic project and may require further enhancements for production use.
